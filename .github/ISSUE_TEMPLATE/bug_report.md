1. What are you saying to Alexa?
2. What video are you trying to play? Please provide the youtube URL.
3. Are you running your own lambda instance, or are you using mine? (ie What is your endpoint? Is it "arn:aws:lambda:eu-west-1:175548706300:function:YouTube"?)
4. If you are running your own lambda instance, have you uploaded the latest lambda_function.zip file? This changes regularly to fix problems.
